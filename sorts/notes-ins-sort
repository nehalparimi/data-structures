start with index = 1
    for each index
        compare with array[0 : i - 1]
        this is a pairwise compare that zips from i - 1 to 0
        if there is a mismatch (if i < i - 1) swap
        continue till i > i - 1
    => each index: O(n)
    => on average, n/2 swaps per value in the case of a reverse-sorted array (starting from 1 to n - 1)
    worst case running time of insertion sort is O(n^2)

    After implementation:
        1. Have a pointer that decrements with the value we need to sort
        2. Loop in Loop

        goal also: implement binary insertion sort
